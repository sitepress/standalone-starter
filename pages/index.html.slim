    p.text-2xl.text-brown-900.dark:text-brown-400.opacity-70 Sitepress is a site generator built on top of Rails, which means you can embed it in a Rails app or run it stand-alone for static or server-side rendered websites.

      markdown:
        Static site generators are great frameworks for compiling static websites and publishing them to the web, but they force you to choose between running them completely static or inside of a Rails application. Sitepress lets you do both!

        Database-backed Rails content management systems like [Refinery CMS](http://www.refinerycms.com) and [Radiant CMS](http://radiantcms.org) are difficult to sync between development, test, staging, and production environments, making them difficult to use in multi-stage development or test-driven development workflows.

        Projects like [High Voltage](https://github.com/thoughtbot/high_voltage) make it possible to embed a small, basic site into Rails, but they lack powerful features like Frontmatter and Sitemap APIs required to make building non-trivial content sites possible. It also doesn't ship with a static site compiler.

        Sitepress is the missing piece. It has all the powerful features you'd expect from a fully featured static site generator, like Frontmatter support and hierarchal page traversal, but it's capable of being embedded inside any Rails, Sinatra, or Rack app. Since all of the content is just a bunch of files, its easy to incorporate Sitepress into a multi-stage or test-driven work environment.

        If you're a soloprenuer building Rails applications, you'll love how easy it is to build content websites in your Rails app, which means you can spend more time shipping and less time worrying about your content management system.
