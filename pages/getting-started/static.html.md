Sitepress ships with a static site compiler. To get started, install the sitepress gem:

```bash
$ gem install sitepress
```

Then create a new sitepress site with:

```bash
$ sitepress new ./my-site
```

This command generates a skeleton site and bundles dependencies into the project. Next, you'll want to change the directory to the project:

```bash
$ cd ./my-site
```

Then fire up the preview server:

```bash
$ sitepress server
```

Your site will now be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`
